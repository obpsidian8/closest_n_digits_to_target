# closest_n_digits_to_target
Just a solution to a random problem that popped up in my head while studying ML classification. 
Was considering how given a target number and a list of numbers, I could get the top N digits where the top N digits are ranked in order of their closeness to the given target.
The function is my implementation of a solution to solving this problem.
Function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the closest N digits to that target. "N" is the third parameter of the function
